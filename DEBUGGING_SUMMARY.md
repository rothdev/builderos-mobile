# 🔍 Black Screen Debugging - Ready to Diagnose

## What I Did

Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the entire app initialization and rendering pipeline. No more guessing - we'll see EXACTLY where execution stops or what fails.

## Files Modified

1. **BuilderOSApp.swift** - App entry point logging
2. **BuilderOSAPIClient.swift** - API client initialization logging
3. **MainContentView.swift** - Tab view rendering logging
4. **DashboardView.swift** - Dashboard rendering logging
5. **UnifiedTerminalView.swift** - Terminal view logging
6. **LocalhostPreviewView.swift** - Preview view logging
7. **SettingsView.swift** - Settings view logging

## New Files Created

1. **DiagnosticView.swift** - Emergency test view (bright green background, giant red text)
2. **DEBUG_CHECKLIST.md** - Step-by-step diagnostic instructions

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - App compiles with all debug logging

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Run App from Xcode (Cmd+R)

Select iPhone 17 simulator or your physical iPhone and run.

### Step 2: Watch Xcode Console

Open the console (Cmd+Shift+Y) and look for green circle (🟢) emoji logs.

**Expected log sequence:**
```
🟢 APP: BuilderOSApp init() starting
🟢 APP: Development mode - onboarding skipped
🟢 APP: BuilderOSApp init() complete
🟢 APP: Building WindowGroup, hasCompletedOnboarding=true
🟢 APP: Showing MainContentView
🟢 API: BuilderOSAPIClient init() starting
🟢 API: BuilderOSAPIClient init() complete
🟢 MAIN: MainContentView body rendering, selectedTab=0
🟢 DASH: DashboardView body rendering, isLoading=false, capsules.count=0
🟢 TERM: UnifiedTerminalView body rendering
🟢 PREVIEW: LocalhostPreviewView body rendering
🟢 SETTINGS: SettingsView body rendering
🟢 API: Loading saved configuration
🟢 API: Configuration loaded, hasAPIKey=false
```

### Step 3: Identify the Problem

**Copy ALL console output** and share it. Pay special attention to:
- ✅ Last log line you see (where execution stops)
- ❌ Any red error messages
- ⚠️ Any yellow warnings
- 🔴 Any crashes (SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, Thread 1: Fatal error)

### Step 4: If All Logs Appear But Screen Is Still Black

This means views ARE rendering but something visual is wrong. Try the diagnostic view:

1. Open `BuilderOSApp.swift`
2. Find line 40: `MainContentView()`
3. Replace with: `DiagnosticView()`
4. Run again (Cmd+R)
5. **If you see bright green screen with red text:**
   - SwiftUI is working
   - Problem is in MainContentView/TabView/child views
   - Focus debugging there
6. **If screen is STILL black:**
   - SwiftUI system-level rendering issue
   - Check Info.plist, entitlements, bundle ID
   - Try creating new blank Xcode project to verify Xcode works

## Quick Diagnostic Decision Tree

```
App launches → Black screen
    ↓
Check console logs
    ↓
    ├─ No logs at all
    │  └─ App crashes before main() runs
    │     └─ Check: Info.plist, bundle ID, signing, entitlements
    │
    ├─ Logs stop at "APP: init"
    │  └─ App crashes during initialization
    │     └─ Check: @StateObject initialization, UserDefaults access
    │
    ├─ Logs stop at "APP: Showing MainContentView"
    │  └─ MainContentView crashes on init
    │     └─ Check: @EnvironmentObject missing, child view crashes
    │
    ├─ Logs stop at "MAIN: body rendering"
    │  └─ TabView or child view crashes
    │     └─ Check: DashboardView, UnifiedTerminalView, etc.
    │
    ├─ Logs stop at "DASH: body rendering"
    │  └─ DashboardView crashes during render
    │     └─ Check: Color definitions, API calls, state updates
    │
    └─ All logs present, screen still black
       └─ Views render but visual issue
          └─ Try DiagnosticView (bright green test)
             ├─ DiagnosticView visible
             │  └─ Problem in MainContentView/TabView layout
             │     └─ Check: TabView selection, child view visibility, z-index
             │
             └─ DiagnosticView also black
                └─ SwiftUI system rendering broken
                   └─ Reinstall Xcode, check macOS update, verify GPU drivers
```

## What I Need From You

1. **Complete console output** (copy ALL text from console)
2. **Last log line you see** (the final 🟢 message)
3. **Any error messages** (red text in console)
4. **Screen behavior:**
   - Pure black?
   - White flash then black?
   - Status bar visible?
   - Any UI elements visible at all?
5. **Device info:**
   - Simulator or physical device?
   - Device model?
   - iOS version?

## Next Steps After Diagnosis

Once I see the console output, I'll know:
- Where execution stops (which component crashes)
- What error occurs (if any)
- Whether it's a rendering issue or logic crash

Then I'll fix the ACTUAL problem, not guess at it.

**Ready to debug. Run the app and send me the console output!** 🚀
