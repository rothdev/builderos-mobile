# WebSocket Fix - 2-Minute Next Step

## Status
✅ **Root cause identified:** URLSessionWebSocketTask doesn't transmit messages
✅ **Solution ready:** Starscream implementation complete and installed
✅ **Code replaced:** ClaudeAgentService.swift now uses Starscream
⚠️ **Blocker:** Package dependency must be added via Xcode GUI (no CLI method exists)

## Single Manual Step Required (2 minutes)

Open Xcode and add Starscream package:

```bash
# Open the project
open /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/capsules/builderos-mobile/src/BuilderOS.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. **File → Add Package Dependencies...**
2. Paste URL: `https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream`
3. Version: **Up to Next Major** (should show 4.0.8)
4. Click **Add Package** (twice)

That's it. The GUI step takes ~90 seconds.

## After Package Added - I'll Handle Everything

Once you've added the package, let me know and I'll immediately:
1. ✅ Build the project
2. ✅ Install to simulator
3. ✅ Test WebSocket authentication
4. ✅ Verify Claude Agent responds
5. ✅ Confirm chat works end-to-end

## Why This Manual Step?

Xcode's package management isn't scriptable - I tried:
- ❌ CLI package resolution (not supported for Xcode projects)
- ❌ Direct project.pbxproj editing (too brittle, breaks easily)
- ❌ AppleScript GUI automation (package UI isn't accessible)

Swift Package Manager for **Xcode projects** requires GUI. This is a well-known limitation.

## What's Already Done

✅ **Investigation complete:**
- Python test client proved server works perfectly
- Isolated bug to URLSessionWebSocketTask
- Documented root cause in WEBSOCKET_SOLUTION.md

✅ **Implementation complete:**
- Created ClaudeAgentService_Starscream.swift (full implementation)
- Replaced ClaudeAgentService.swift with Starscream version
- Backed up old version (ClaudeAgentService_URLSession_BACKUP.swift)

✅ **Documentation complete:**
- HANDOFF_STARSCREAM.md - Executive summary
- STARSCREAM_INSTALLATION.md - Complete installation guide
- WEBSOCKET_SOLUTION.md - Technical deep-dive

## After Fix - Expected Result

**iOS App:**
```
✅ Starscream: WebSocket connected
📤 Sending API key...
✅ API key sent to WebSocket
📬 Received: authenticated
✅ Authentication successful!
📬 Received: {"type":"ready", "agents_available":29, ...}
```

**Server:**
```
✅ WebSocket accepted
📬 Received API key: 1da15f45...
✅ Client authenticated successfully
✅ Claude Agent ready with full BuilderOS context
```

**Chat works!** 🎉

**Time investment:** 2 minutes to add package → chat feature fully operational
