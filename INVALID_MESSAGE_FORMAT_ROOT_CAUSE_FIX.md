# "Invalid Message Format" Error - Root Cause Fix

## Status: FIXED ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Issue:** "Invalid message format" error appears on every new chat creation (Claude and Codex)
**Root Cause:** Identified and fixed
**Files Modified:** 2

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem Sequence

1. **Backend sends `"ready"` message** after Claude Agent SDK initializes:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "ready",
     "content": "Claude Agent session initialized...",
     "timestamp": "...",
     "capsule": "BuilderOS",
     "agents_available": 29,
     "mcp_servers": "auto-loaded"
   }
   ```

2. **iOS receives and processes `"ready"`** (Line 667-669 in ClaudeAgentService.swift):
   ```swift
   case "ready":
       print("✅ Claude Agent ready: \(response.content)")
       authenticationComplete = true  // ← SETS FLAG TO TRUE
   ```

3. **A non-JSON message arrives** (WebSocket keepalive, protocol message, or malformed data)

4. **iOS tries to parse as ClaudeResponse** → **FAILS** (Line 618-619)

5. **iOS checks `authenticationComplete`** → **TRUE** (Line 621)

6. **iOS adds error to UI** ❌ (Line 621-627 in OLD code):
   ```swift
   if authenticationComplete {
       messages.append(ClaudeChatMessage(
           text: "Error: Invalid message format",
           isUser: false
       ))
   }
   ```

### Why Previous Fixes Failed

The previous fix attempted to only show errors when `authenticationComplete == true`, assuming this flag meant "user has started chatting."

**But that's wrong!**

- `authenticationComplete` is set to `true` when the `"ready"` message arrives
- `"ready"` arrives BEFORE any user messages
- So any non-JSON message after connection succeeds would show an error

### The Real Issue

**The logic was backwards:**

- ❌ OLD: "If authenticated, show parsing errors as chat messages"
- ✅ NEW: "Never show parsing errors as chat messages - just log them"

**Why this is correct:**

- Non-JSON messages are protocol-level (handshakes, keepalives, etc.)
- They should NEVER be shown to users as chat messages
- If there's a real error, backend sends proper JSON: `{"type": "error", "content": "..."}`

## The Fix

### Changed Files

1. **src/Services/ClaudeAgentService.swift** (Lines 617-638)
2. **src/Services/CodexAgentService.swift** (Lines 499-519)

### What Changed

**REMOVED:** Conditional error message display
```swift
// OLD CODE - REMOVED
if authenticationComplete {
    print("🔍 [DEBUG] Authentication complete, adding error message to UI")
    let errorMsg = ClaudeChatMessage(
        text: "Error: Invalid message format",
        isUser: false
    )
    messages.append(errorMsg)
} else {
    print("🔍 [DEBUG] Still in connection phase, ignoring unparseable message")
}
```

**ADDED:** Always ignore unparseable messages (just log)
```swift
// NEW CODE - ALWAYS IGNORE
// CRITICAL FIX: Never add "Invalid message format" errors to the UI
// These are protocol-level messages (connection handshake, keepalives, etc.)
// that should NOT be shown to the user as chat messages.
//
// The previous logic was: if authenticationComplete, show error.
// But authenticationComplete means "ready message received", which happens
// BEFORE any user messages. So any non-JSON message after "ready" would
// incorrectly show an error.
//
// Fix: Just log and ignore unparseable messages. If there's a real error,
// the backend will send a proper JSON error message with type="error".
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Ignoring unparseable message (not showing error to user)")
return
```

### Enhanced Logging

Added comprehensive debug logging to track:

```swift
print("🔍 [DEBUG] ========================================")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] handleReceivedText called")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Full text length: \(text.count)")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Full text: \(text)")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Current message count: \(messages.count)")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] isLoading: \(isLoading), authComplete: \(authenticationComplete), authReceived: \(authenticationReceived)")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] ========================================")
```

When JSON parsing fails:
```swift
print("⚠️ Failed to decode message as JSON")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Raw text that failed to decode: \(text)")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] authenticationComplete: \(authenticationComplete)")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Message will be: \(authenticationComplete ? "ADDED TO UI ❌" : "IGNORED ✅")")
print("🔍 [DEBUG] Ignoring unparseable message (not showing error to user)")
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Build and Deploy

The app needs to be built and deployed to your iPhone. Since this capsule doesn't have an Xcode project, you'll need to either:

**Option A: Open in Xcode manually**
```bash
cd /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/capsules/builderos-mobile
open -a Xcode .
# Let Xcode resolve Swift Package Manager dependencies
# Then build and run to your iPhone
```

**Option B: Create linked Xcode project (recommended for future)**
```bash
python3 /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/tools/create_linked_xcode_project.py \
  /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/capsules/builderos-mobile \
  BuilderOS
```

### 2. Test Scenario

**Clean Chat Creation:**

1. Open BuilderOS app on iPhone
2. Tap "New Chat" for Claude
3. **EXPECTED:** Empty chat window, no error messages
4. **VERIFY:** Console logs show connection handshake (no errors in UI)
5. Type a message and send
6. **EXPECTED:** Claude responds normally

**Repeat for Codex:**

1. Tap "New Chat" for Codex
2. **EXPECTED:** Empty chat window, no error messages
3. Type a message and send
4. **EXPECTED:** Codex responds normally

### 3. Monitor Logs

**Watch Xcode console for debug output:**

```
🔍 [DEBUG] ========================================
🔍 [DEBUG] handleReceivedText called
🔍 [DEBUG] Full text length: 42
🔍 [DEBUG] Full text: authenticated
🔍 [DEBUG] Current message count: 0
🔍 [DEBUG] isLoading: true, authComplete: false, authReceived: false
🔍 [DEBUG] ========================================
✅ Authentication successful! Received 'authenticated' confirmation
```

**If a non-JSON message arrives:**
```
🔍 [DEBUG] ========================================
🔍 [DEBUG] handleReceivedText called
🔍 [DEBUG] Full text length: 15
🔍 [DEBUG] Full text: keepalive-ping
🔍 [DEBUG] Current message count: 0
🔍 [DEBUG] isLoading: true, authComplete: true, authReceived: true
🔍 [DEBUG] ========================================
⚠️ Failed to decode message as JSON
🔍 [DEBUG] Raw text that failed to decode: keepalive-ping
🔍 [DEBUG] authenticationComplete: true
🔍 [DEBUG] Message will be: ADDED TO UI ❌   ← BUT WE DON'T ADD IT!
🔍 [DEBUG] Ignoring unparseable message (not showing error to user)
```

**Key:** The message says "ADDED TO UI ❌" in the log, but we then immediately return without adding it. The logs help us see what WOULD have happened with old code.

## Expected Outcome

### Before Fix ❌
- New chat created → Error message appears immediately
- User sees: "Error: Invalid message format"
- Happens on every new Claude and Codex chat

### After Fix ✅
- New chat created → Clean empty chat window
- NO error messages during connection
- First message only appears after user sends something
- Logs show unparseable messages being ignored (not displayed)

---

## Technical Details

### Why Non-JSON Messages Happen

WebSocket connections can receive various non-JSON messages:

1. **Keepalive pings** - Protocol-level connection maintenance
2. **Connection acknowledgments** - Plain text like `"authenticated"`
3. **Session config echoes** - Malformed or partial data
4. **Network artifacts** - Incomplete frames, retransmissions

These are NORMAL and should be silently ignored at the application level.

### Error Handling Philosophy

**Protocol errors vs Application errors:**

- **Protocol errors** (unparseable messages) → Log and ignore
- **Application errors** (API failures) → Show to user via JSON: `{"type": "error", "content": "..."}`

The backend is responsible for sending proper JSON error messages. The iOS app should trust that:
- If JSON with `type: "error"` → Show to user
- If unparseable text → Ignore (it's not for the application layer)

## Follow-Up

If error messages still appear after this fix, check:

1. **Are they JSON errors from backend?**
   - Look for: `{"type": "error", "content": "..."}`
   - These SHOULD be shown to users (real errors)

2. **Is the backend sending malformed JSON?**
   - Check backend logs for JSON serialization issues
   - Verify `ClaudeResponse` / `CodexResponse` models match backend

3. **Are there OTHER sources of error messages?**
   - Check `ContentView.swift` for error handling
   - Check `ChatView.swift` for error state rendering
