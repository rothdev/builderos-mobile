cd /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/capsules/builder-system-mobile
open src/BuilderOS.xcodeproj

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select your iPhone from device dropdown
# 2. Click Run (Cmd+R)
# 3. Wait for build to complete
```

### Step 2: Install (2 min)
```
On iPhone:
1. App installs automatically from Xcode
2. Tap app icon ‚Üí "Untrusted Developer" message
3. Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
4. Trust your Apple ID developer certificate
```

### Step 3: Test (15 min)
Follow `TONIGHT_QUICK_START.md`:
- Complete onboarding
- Navigate all tabs
- Test localhost preview (if dev server running)
- Configure API key
- Check Dark mode
- Report any issues

### Step 4: Celebrate üéâ
