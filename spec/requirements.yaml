project:
  name: Builder System Mobile
  slug: builder-system-mobile
  branch: app
  targets: ["ios_app"]
  app_kind: personal

objectives:
  - Mobile-first chat interface for Builder System remote access and control.
  - Connect to Builder System server via SSH with session management.
  - Chat-style interface optimized for mobile interaction with Claude Code / CodeX.
  - Voice input via Whisper dictation with one-tap recording for command entry.
  - Voice output via TTS for accessibility and hands-free operation.
  - Push notifications for critical Builder System events and approvals.
  - Clean, modern iOS design following system Light/Dark Mode.
  - Quick access to common Builder operations (health checks, capsule builds, status).

constraints:
  budget_tokens: 0
  runtime_envs: ["iOS", "SSH"]
  secrets: ["SSH_PRIVATE_KEY", "APNS_AUTH_KEY"]

inputs:
  data_sources: ["Builder System SSH endpoint", "Claude Code sessions", "CodeX sessions"]

outputs:
  deliverables:
    - Native iOS application
    - SSH connection and session management
    - Chat-style interface with voice I/O
    - Push notification integration
    - Builder System operation shortcuts

definition_of_done:
  - App connects to Builder System server and establishes SSH session in â‰¤3s.
  - Chat interface displays Builder System output with mobile-optimized formatting.
  - Voice input via Whisper with one-tap start/stop transcribes and sends commands accurately.
  - Voice output via TTS reads Builder System responses clearly.
  - Push notifications for critical events arrive and deep-link to relevant context.
  - Light/Dark theme follows iOS system settings automatically.
  - Common Builder operations accessible via quick actions or chat commands.

notes:
  focus: "Personal mobile companion for Builder System - prioritize usability over terminal accuracy"
  risks:
    - Push notifications require Apple Developer setup and server-side helper
    - SSH key management and security on mobile device
  assumptions:
    - User has Builder System running on accessible server
    - User willing to install lightweight notification helper on server
