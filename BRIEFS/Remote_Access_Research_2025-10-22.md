## Wake-on-LAN Solutions

**The Challenge:** WOL packets are broadcast, don't route over internet by default.

### Recommended Approaches

#### Option 1: Raspberry Pi Intermediary (Best)
- Keep Pi on local network, always powered
- iOS app ‚Üí Tailscale ‚Üí Pi ‚Üí WOL packet ‚Üí Mac
- Cost: $35 (one-time) + negligible power
- Reliability: Excellent
- Setup: 4/10 complexity

#### Option 2: Router with WOL Support
- Many modern routers have built-in WOL client
- Configure via OpenWRT, DD-WRT, Asuswrt-Merlin
- iOS app ‚Üí Tailscale ‚Üí Router admin ‚Üí WOL trigger
- Cost: $0 (if router supports it)
- Reliability: Good
- Setup: 5/10 complexity

#### Option 3: VPN + Static ARP Entry
- Add static ARP entry on router for Mac
- iOS ‚Üí Tailscale/WireGuard ‚Üí Router ‚Üí WOL packet
- Avoids ARP cache expiration issue
- Cost: $0
- Reliability: Moderate (depends on router firmware)
- Setup: 6/10 complexity

### Sleep API Implementation

**Simple solution:** Add to BuilderOS API:

```python
@app.post("/system/sleep")
async def sleep_mac():
    """Put Mac to sleep"""
    subprocess.run(["pmset", "sleepnow"])
    return {"status": "sleeping"}
```

**iOS integration:**
```swift
// Assuming Tailscale running
let macIP = "100.64.1.5"  // Tailscale IP
try await URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "http://\(macIP):8080/system/sleep")!)
```

**No tunnel needed if using Tailscale** - direct device-to-device connection.

## Screen Preview Solutions

### Option 1: VNC over Tailscale (Recommended)
- **Built into macOS:** Screen Sharing (VNC) already available
- **Setup:**
  - macOS: System Settings ‚Üí Sharing ‚Üí Screen Sharing (enable)
  - iOS: Install VNC viewer app (e.g., RealVNC Viewer - free)
  - Connect via Tailscale IP: `vnc://100.64.1.5`
- **Cost:** $0
- **Quality:** Excellent, real-time screen viewing
- **Complexity:** 2/10

### Option 2: Custom Screenshot API
**BuilderOS API endpoint:**
```python
@app.get("/system/screenshot")
async def get_screenshot():
    """Return current screenshot as image"""
    subprocess.run(["screencapture", "/tmp/screen.png"])
    return FileResponse("/tmp/screen.png")
```

**iOS app:**
```swift
let url = URL(string: "http://\(macIP):8080/system/screenshot")!
let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
let image = UIImage(data: data)
```

- **Cost:** $0
- **Quality:** Static images, not real-time
- **Complexity:** 3/10 (API development)

### Alternative: Cloudflare Tunnel (If Tailscale VPN Conflict Unacceptable)

If you absolutely need ProtonVPN active on iPhone at all times:

**Why this works:**
- Not a VPN, so no iOS VPN conflict
- Both devices can run ProtonVPN simultaneously
- API accessible via HTTPS tunnel URL

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires domain (or accept random URLs)
- Can't wake Mac from sleep (Mac must be running)
- No screen sharing (would need VNC separately)

**Implementation:**
1. Create Cloudflare account
2. Add domain (or use *.trycloudflare.com)
3. Install cloudflared on Mac as service
4. Configure persistent tunnel
5. iOS app uses HTTPS: `https://builder.yourdomain.com/api/...`

**Cost:** $0 (or ~$10/yr for domain)
