## 💡 Pro Tips

**Reviewing the Preview:**
1. View on a large screen (desktop monitor) for best experience
2. Toggle dark mode to see both themes
3. Click all buttons to see active states
4. Imagine using it on your actual iPhone

**Providing Feedback:**
- Screenshot specific areas you want changed
- Reference exact screens ("Chat Screen input bar is too small")
- Compare to other apps you like ("Make it more like Apple Messages")

**Thinking Ahead:**
- This is MVP (Phase 1) - future features come later
- Focus on core chat experience now
