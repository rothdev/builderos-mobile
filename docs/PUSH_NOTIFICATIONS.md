# Push Notifications Implementation

## Overview

BuilderOS Mobile now supports push notifications to alert users when agent jobs complete on the Mac. This implementation includes:

- ‚úÖ User notification permission flow
- ‚úÖ Local notification testing (MVP)
- ‚úÖ Foundation for future APNs integration
- ‚úÖ Settings UI for testing notifications

## Architecture

### Components

**1. NotificationManager.swift**
- Singleton service managing all notification operations
- Handles permission requests and device token registration
- Provides test notification methods for MVP
- Implements UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate for notification handling

**2. BuilderOSApp.swift**
- Configures notification delegate on app launch
- Requests notification permissions automatically
- Handles APNs device token callbacks (ready for future backend)

**3. BuilderOS.entitlements**
- Declares `aps-environment` for push notification capability
- Required for both local and remote notifications

**4. SettingsView.swift (DEBUG mode only)**
- Test UI for triggering local notifications
- Shows permission status and device token
- Quick test buttons for common notification types

## Current Implementation (MVP)

### Phase 1: Local Notifications ‚úÖ

**What works NOW:**
- Request notification permission on first launch
- Send local test notifications
- Handle notification taps (opens app)
- Display notifications in foreground and background
- Sound and badge support

**Testing:**
1. Launch app ‚Üí permission dialog appears
2. Grant permission
3. Open Settings tab
4. Scroll to "NOTIFICATIONS (TESTING)" section (DEBUG builds only)
5. Tap test buttons:
   - "Build Complete ‚úÖ"
   - "Tests Passed ‚úÖ"
   - "Deployment Complete üöÄ"
6. Notifications appear immediately

**Test Commands:**
```swift
// From anywhere with NotificationManager access:
await notificationManager.sendBuildCompleteNotification()
await notificationManager.sendTestsPassedNotification()
await notificationManager.sendDeploymentCompleteNotification()

// Custom notification:
await notificationManager.sendTestNotification(
    title: "Agent Job Complete",
    body: "Your task has finished successfully"
)
```

## Future Implementation (APNs Backend)

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (Not Yet Implemented)

**Required Backend Work:**

**1. Device Token Registration API**
```
POST /api/notifications/register
Authorization: Bearer {api_key}

Body:
{
    "device_token": "abc123...",
    "platform": "ios"
}
```

**2. Job Completion Webhook**
When BuilderOS agent jobs complete, send push notification:
```
POST to APNs with payload:
{
    "aps": {
        "alert": {
            "title": "Build Complete ‚úÖ",
            "body": "iOS app built successfully in 45 seconds"
        },
        "sound": "default",
        "badge": 1
    },
    "job_id": "build-1234",
    "job_type": "build",
    "status": "success"
}
```

**3. iOS App Changes (Already Ready)**
The app already handles device token registration:
```swift
// In BuilderOSApp.swift - already implemented
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data
) {
    // Device token is captured and logged
    // TODO: Send to backend API
}
```

### Phase 3: Production Setup Checklist

**When ready for APNs:**

**Apple Developer Portal:**
- [ ] Enable Push Notifications for App ID
- [ ] Create APNs certificate or key
- [ ] Update provisioning profile with push capability
- [ ] Change entitlements from `development` to `production`

**Backend Setup:**
- [ ] Store APNs credentials (key or certificate)
- [ ] Implement device token registration endpoint
- [ ] Implement push notification sending logic
- [ ] Add job completion hooks to trigger notifications

**iOS App:**
- [ ] Update NotificationManager to send device token to backend
- [ ] Add error handling for registration failures
- [ ] Implement deep linking for notification taps
- [ ] Add notification categories for actions

**Testing:**
- [ ] Test on real device (Simulator doesn't support APNs)
- [ ] Test with development APNs
- [ ] Verify notifications arrive on locked screen
- [ ] Test notification tap navigation
- [ ] Verify badge updates correctly

## Code Reference

### Request Permission
```swift
// Automatic on app launch
// Or manually:
await NotificationManager.shared.requestAuthorization()
```

### Send Test Notification (Local)
```swift
await NotificationManager.shared.sendTestNotification(
    title: "Job Complete",
    body: "Your task finished successfully"
)
```

### Check Permission Status
```swift
// Reactive property - updates UI automatically
@EnvironmentObject var notificationManager: NotificationManager

Text(notificationManager.isAuthorized ? "Authorized" : "Not Authorized")
```

### Handle Notification Tap
```swift
// Already implemented in NotificationManager
func handleNotificationTap(_ response: UNNotificationResponse) {
    let userInfo = response.notification.request.content.userInfo
    // TODO: Navigate to relevant screen based on userInfo
}
```

## Notification Types

### Planned Job Completion Notifications

**Build Jobs:**
- "Build Complete ‚úÖ" - Successful build
- "Build Failed ‚ùå" - Build error with details
- "Build Cancelled ‚ö†Ô∏è" - User cancelled build

**Test Jobs:**
- "Tests Passed ‚úÖ" - All tests successful
- "Tests Failed ‚ùå" - Test failures with count
- "Coverage Updated üìä" - Code coverage report

**Deployment Jobs:**
- "Deployment Complete üöÄ" - Successful deploy
- "Deployment Failed ‚ùå" - Deploy error
- "App Live üéâ" - App successfully published

**Agent Jobs:**
- "Agent Complete" - Generic job completion
- "Research Complete üîç" - Research results ready
- "Automation Complete ü§ñ" - Workflow finished

## Security Considerations

**Device Token Storage:**
- Device tokens stored in memory only (not persisted)
- Sent to backend API over HTTPS
- Associated with API key for authentication

**Notification Content:**
- Avoid sensitive data in notification body
- Use generic messages for lock screen
- Store details in app, navigate on tap

**Privacy:**
- User can deny permission (app still works)
- Notifications are opt-in
- Clear indication of what notifications do

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied"
- Settings ‚Üí BuilderOS ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Enable
- May need to reinstall app to trigger permission dialog again

### "Notifications Don't Appear"
- Check permission status in Settings tab
- Check Do Not Disturb is off
- Check notification preview settings (iOS Settings)

### "Badge Doesn't Update"
- Badge requires notification permission
- Badge updates via `setBadgeCount()` API (iOS 17+)

### "Device Token Not Generated"
- Device tokens only work on real devices (not Simulator)
- Requires valid provisioning profile with push capability
- Check console logs for registration errors

## Testing Checklist
