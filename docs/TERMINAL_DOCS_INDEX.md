## 🔍 Quick Answers

### Q: Which terminal am I using right now?
**A:** `TerminalChatView` (mock/placeholder)
**Doc:** Quick Reference

### Q: How do I deploy the real terminal?
**A:** Replace `TerminalChatView` with `WebSocketTerminalView` in MainContentView
**Doc:** Investigation Complete → "How to Deploy Real Terminal"

### Q: Why can't I preview in Canvas?
**A:** Build succeeds. Restart Xcode to refresh Canvas cache.
**Doc:** Quick Reference → "Canvas Preview Fix"

### Q: What's the difference between the 3 terminals?
**A:**
- TerminalChatView = Mock placeholder (active now)
- WebSocketTerminalView = Real terminal (ready to deploy)
- MultiTabTerminalView = Multi-tab terminal (advanced option)
**Doc:** Visual Map → "Terminal Evolution Path"

### Q: What files were deleted?
**A:** `RealTerminalView.swift` and `src/ios/BuilderSystemMobile/` directory
**Doc:** Investigation Complete → "Cleaned Up Obsolete Code"

### Q: Are there any build errors?
**A:** No. Build succeeds with zero errors.
**Doc:** Investigation Complete → "Build Verification"

## 🎯 Key Files to Know

### Active in App Right Now
```
src/Views/MainContentView.swift
    └── Line 22: TerminalChatView() ← This is what you see
```

### Ready to Deploy When WebSocket API is Ready
```
src/Views/WebSocketTerminalView.swift ← Real terminal
src/Views/MultiTabTerminalView.swift  ← Multi-tab option
```

### How to Switch Terminals
```
Edit: src/Views/MainContentView.swift
Change line 22-25 from:
    TerminalChatView()
To:
    WebSocketTerminalView(
        baseURL: apiClient.tunnelURL,
        apiKey: apiClient.apiKey,
        profile: .shell
    )
```

## ✅ Checklist: Before Deploying Real Terminal

- [ ] Read "Investigation Complete" → "How to Deploy Real Terminal" section
- [ ] Ensure WebSocket API endpoint exists: `/api/terminal/ws`
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection from Mac terminal: `wscat -c wss://[tunnel]/api/terminal/ws`
- [ ] Update MainContentView.swift to use WebSocketTerminalView
- [ ] Build and test on simulator
- [ ] Verify terminal commands work (ls, cd, git status)
- [ ] Test ANSI color parsing
- [ ] Test autocomplete suggestions
- [ ] Test terminal resize on device rotation
- [ ] Test on physical device (not just simulator)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Canvas won't preview terminal views
**Solution:** Quick Reference → "Canvas Preview Fix"
**TL;DR:** Clean build folder + Restart Xcode

### Problem: Don't know which terminal is active
**Solution:** Quick Reference → "Which Terminal Am I Using Right Now?"
**TL;DR:** `TerminalChatView` (mock)

### Problem: Want real terminal but don't have WebSocket API
**Solution:** Architecture Guide → "What's Missing for Full Terminal"
**TL;DR:** Need `/api/terminal/ws` endpoint on BuilderOS API

### Problem: Confused about multiple terminal views
**Solution:** Visual Map → "Terminal Evolution Path"
**TL;DR:** 3 phases: Mock (now) → WebSocket → Multi-tab

### Problem: Build errors after switching terminals
**Solution:** Architecture Guide → "Supporting Components"
**TL;DR:** All dependencies in target. Restart Xcode.
