# Penpot MCP Write Capabilities - Activated

## ✅ Activation Complete

The extended Penpot MCP server with write capabilities has been configured and is ready to use.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Claude Code BuilderOS Configuration
**File**: `/Users/Ty/BuilderOS/capsules/builder-system-mobile/.mcp.json`

Added Penpot MCP server to capsule configuration:
```json
"penpot": {
  "command": "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3",
  "args": ["-m", "penpot_mcp.server.mcp_server"],
  "env": {
    "PENPOT_API_URL": "http://localhost:3449/api",
    "PENPOT_USERNAME": "admin@localhost.local",
    "PENPOT_PASSWORD": "123123",
    "ENABLE_HTTP_SERVER": "true",
    "RESOURCES_AS_TOOLS": "false",
    "DEBUG": "false"
  }
}
```

### 2. Killed Old Processes
Terminated any running penpot-mcp processes to ensure clean startup.

## Next Steps

### RESTART CLAUDE CODE

**You must restart Claude Code** for the changes to take effect:

1. **Close this Claude Code session** completely
2. **Reopen Claude Code** in this directory
3. The new Penpot MCP server will start automatically with write capabilities

### After Restart - Available Tools

You'll have access to these new MCP tools:

#### Read Operations (existing)
- `mcp__penpot__list_projects()` - List all projects
- `mcp__penpot__get_project_files(project_id)` - Get files in a project
- `mcp__penpot__get_file(file_id)` - Get file data
- `mcp__penpot__export_object(...)` - Export design objects
- `mcp__penpot__search_object(...)` - Search for objects
- `mcp__penpot__get_object_tree(...)` - Get object tree with screenshot

#### Write Operations (NEW!)
- `mcp__penpot__create_project(name, team_id)` - Create a new project
- `mcp__penpot__create_file(name, project_id, is_shared)` - Create a new file

## Testing the Write Capabilities

After restart, test with:

```python
# Create a new project
result = mcp__penpot__create_project(name="Test Project")
project_id = result['project']['id']

# Create a file in the project
file_result = mcp__penpot__create_file(
    name="Dashboard Screen",
    project_id=project_id,
    is_shared=False
)
file_id = file_result['file']['id']
```

## BuilderOS Mobile Workflow

Once confirmed working, use the UI Designer to:

1. Create "BuilderOS Mobile" project
2. Create design files for each screen:
   - Dashboard (capsule grid, system status)
   - Chat/Terminal (command interface, voice input)
   - Localhost Preview (WebView container)
   - Settings (API key, connection management)
   - Onboarding (first-time setup flow)

## Troubleshooting

If tools don't appear after restart:
1. Check MCP server logs in Claude Code
2. Verify Penpot Docker container is running: `docker ps | grep penpot`
3. Test authentication manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3449/api/rpc/command/login-with-password \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"~:email":"admin@localhost.local","~:password":"123123"}'
   ```

## Status
✅ Configuration updated
✅ Old processes killed
⏳ **Waiting for Claude Code restart**

---

**Action Required**: Restart Claude Code to activate the new MCP server with write capabilities.
