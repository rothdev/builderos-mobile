3. **Select BuilderOS** â†’ **"Sign"**
4. **Install again** (same process as Step 2e)

Or rebuild from Xcode (Product â†’ Archive) for latest code.

## Xcode Alternative (Faster for Development)

For quick testing during development:

```bash
# Connect iPhone via USB
# In Xcode: Select your iPhone from device dropdown
# Click Run (Cmd+R)
# Trust developer on iPhone
```

App installs in ~30 seconds but still expires after 7 days.
