### 4. Updated Files

- ✅ **ChatMessage.swift**
  - Added `fileAttachmentCount: Int` property
  - Updated initializer to accept attachment count

- ✅ **ChatViewModel.swift**
  - Added `@Published var attachments: [FileAttachment] = []`
  - Added `uploadService: FileUploadService`
  - Updated `sendMessage` to handle attachments
  - New methods: `addAttachment`, `removeAttachment`, `uploadAttachments`
  - Async file upload before sending message

- ✅ **VoiceInputView.swift**
  - Added attachment button (paperclip icon)
  - Attachment chips horizontal scroll view
  - Photo/Document picker sheets
  - Confirmation dialog for attachment type selection
  - Visual feedback (icon changes when attachments present)

- ✅ **Info.plist**
  - Added `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
  - Added `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
1. User taps paperclip button
   ↓
2. Confirmation dialog: Photos or Documents?
   ↓
3. System picker presented (PHPicker or UIDocumentPicker)
   ↓
4. User selects files → FileAttachment models created
   ↓
5. Attachments displayed as chips (horizontal scroll)
   ↓
6. User types message + taps send
   ↓
7. ChatViewModel uploads files via FileUploadService
   ↓
8. Message sent with attachment count metadata
   ↓
9. Attachments cleared from UI
```

### Key Features

**Photo Upload:**
- Multi-select (up to 5 images)
- JPEG compression for efficiency
- Async loading with UI updates on main thread
- Photo library permission handling

**Document Upload:**
- Wide file type support (10+ types)
- Security-scoped resource access
- MIME type auto-detection
- Multi-select support

**UI/UX:**
- Liquid glass design system integration
- Smooth animations (attachment chips appear/disappear)
- Upload progress indicators
- Visual feedback (paperclip icon changes)
- Accessibility support

**Error Handling:**
- Custom `FileUploadError` enum
- Network error catching
- Invalid URL detection
- HTTP status code validation

## Build Status

**✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED**

```bash
xcodebuild -project src/BuilderOS.xcodeproj \
  -scheme BuilderOS \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  clean build
```

**Result:** Zero compilation errors
**Warnings:** 3 pre-existing deprecation warnings (unrelated to file upload)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Photo picker opens on "Photos" button
- [ ] Document picker opens on "Documents" button
- [ ] Selected files display as chips
- [ ] Remove button works on chips
- [ ] Paperclip icon changes when attachments present
- [ ] Attachments upload when message sent
- [ ] Attachments clear after send
- [ ] Photo library permission prompt appears
- [ ] Multi-select works (photos and documents)
- [ ] File size displays correctly (bytes/KB/MB)
- [ ] Upload progress shows during upload

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify upload endpoint exists on backend
- [ ] Test file upload success/failure flows
- [ ] Verify message metadata includes attachment count
- [ ] Test with various file types (PDF, images, text)
- [ ] Test with large files (network timeout handling)

## Design System Compliance

**✅ Liquid Glass Aesthetic:**
- Blur backgrounds on chips (`Color(.systemGray6)`)
- Rounded corners (12pt radius)
- Subtle borders (`Color(.systemGray4)`)
- Smooth animations (opacity + move transitions)
- SF Symbols icons
- Semantic colors (blue for photos, orange for documents)

**✅ Performance:**
- JPEG compression (0.8 quality) for photos
- Async/await for non-blocking uploads
- Main thread UI updates
- Efficient list rendering (ForEach with Identifiable)

## Next Steps

### Backend Integration
1. Create `/api/upload` endpoint to receive multipart/form-data
2. Return uploaded file URLs or IDs
3. Store file metadata with messages

### Enhanced Features (Future)
- Image preview thumbnails in chips
- Drag and drop support (iPad)
- iCloud Drive integration
- File size limits and validation
- Video preview playback
- Audio file waveform display

### Testing
1. Run on physical device to test photo library access
2. Test with various file sizes (1KB - 10MB+)
3. Verify network error handling
4. Test with poor network conditions
5. Accessibility testing (VoiceOver support)

## Implementation Notes

### Why PHPickerViewController?
- Modern replacement for UIImagePickerController
- Better privacy (no full photo library access needed)
- Multi-select support built-in
- iOS 14+ standard

### Why UIDocumentPickerViewController?
- System-standard file picker
- iCloud Drive integration
- Security-scoped resources (sandboxing compliant)
- Wide file type support via UniformTypeIdentifiers

### Why Multipart/Form-Data?
- Standard for file uploads
- Compatible with most backend frameworks
- Supports metadata + file data in single request
- Efficient for binary data
