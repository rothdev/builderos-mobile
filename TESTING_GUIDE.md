## Common Issues & Solutions

### Terminal shows "Not Configured"
**Solution:** Go to Settings and enter tunnel URL + API key

### Connection fails immediately
**Solution:**
1. Check tunnel URL is correct (no trailing slash)
2. Verify API server is running on Mac
3. Verify Cloudflare tunnel is active
4. Check API key matches server output

### Colors not showing
**Solution:**
1. Test with `ls -la --color=always`
2. Check Xcode console for ANSI parsing errors
3. Verify ANSIParser is working (should see colored text)

### Special keys not working
**Solution:**
1. Check keyboard toolbar is visible
2. Verify terminal is connected (green status)
3. Try simpler keys first (ESC, Tab)
4. Check Xcode console for send errors

### App crashes on launch
**Solution:**
1. Check Xcode console for error messages
2. Verify all files are properly linked
3. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
4. Rebuild project (Cmd+B)

### Terminal freezes
**Solution:**
1. Press Ctrl+C to cancel current command
2. If unresponsive, disconnect and reconnect
3. Check if command is waiting for input

### Scrolling is laggy
**Solution:**
1. Check scrollback buffer size (should be 1000 lines)
2. Clear terminal output (Ctrl+L)
3. Restart terminal tab
4. Check iOS device performance
