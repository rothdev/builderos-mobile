# Connection Issue Resolved ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Issue:** App won't connect to Cloudflare tunnel
**Status:** RESOLVED - Services Running

## What Was Wrong

Both backend API server and Cloudflare tunnel were **NOT running** after the last session ended. They needed to be manually restarted.

## Current Status

### ✅ Backend API Server
```bash
# Running at:
http://localhost:8080

# Health check:
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# {"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0", "timestamp": "..."}
```

###  ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel
```bash
# Running tunnel: builderos-mobile
# Domain: api.builderos.app

# Health check:
curl https://api.builderos.app/api/health
# {"status": "ok", "version": "1.0.0", "timestamp": "..."}
```

### ✅ WebSocket Connection
```bash
# WebSocket endpoint:
wss://api.builderos.app/api/claude/ws

# TESTED AND WORKING:
# - WebSocket handshake successful
# - Backend responding to connections
# - HTTP/2 not blocking WebSocket upgrades
```

## How to Restart Services (if needed)

### Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/capsules/builderos-mobile/api
./start.sh
```

Look for: `✅ Starting server on http://localhost:8080`

### Start Cloudflare Tunnel
```bash
cloudflared tunnel run builderos-mobile
```

Look for: `INF Registered tunnel connection`

## Testing the App

### On iPhone:
1. **Kill and restart the app** (swipe up, fully close)
2. Open BuilderOS app
3. Try the Chat tab
4. Connection should work immediately

### If Still Not Connecting:

1. **Check backend logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/builderos-api.log
   ```

2. **Check tunnel logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/cloudflared-simple.log
   ```

3. **Verify from iPhone's perspective:**
   - iPhone needs internet connection
   - No VPN conflicts
   - No network restrictions

## What the App Should Show

**When connected:**
- Chat tab shows "Connected" status
- Can send messages to Claude
- Receives responses in real-time

**When disconnected:**
- Shows "Connecting..." or "Disconnected"
- May show red indicator
- Check services are running

## Push Notifications Still Work

Even if WebSocket has issues, **APNs push notifications are fully functional**:
- Backend sends push notification on every new message
- Works when app is backgrounded or closed
- Notification appears as iPhone banner
- Tapping opens app to the chat

## Automated Startup (Future)

Consider setting up launchd agents for auto-start:
- Backend API server on Mac login
- Cloudflare tunnel on Mac login
- Restart on crash

## Files Created

- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_NOTES.md` - Detailed tunnel configuration notes
- `CONNECTION_RESOLVED.md` - This file (troubleshooting summary)

---

**Bottom Line:** Both services are now running. Kill and restart the app on your iPhone - it should connect immediately.

**Services Status:**
- ✅ Backend API: Running (localhost:8080)
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel: Running (api.builderos.app)
- ✅ WebSocket Tested: Working
- ✅ Push Notifications: Configured and ready

**Next Step:** Open the app on your iPhone!
