# Coding Standards

## Inheritance Hierarchy
This capsule inherits standards from:
1. Global Agent OS base standards
2. Lane-specific standards (standard)
3. Branch-specific standards (app)
4. Capsule-specific customizations (this file)

## Capsule-Specific Standards

### Architecture Patterns
- Follow Builder capsule structure conventions
- Maintain clean separation between configuration, implementation, and operations
- Use established Builder integration patterns

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for standard requirements
- Integration with Builder logging and monitoring systems
- Proper escalation and notification procedures

### Testing Strategy
- standard testing requirements apply
- Integration testing with Builder system components
- End-to-end testing of key workflows

### Documentation Requirements
- Complete operational runbooks
- Integration and deployment procedures
- Troubleshooting and maintenance guides

### Security Considerations
- Follow Builder security patterns and requirements
- Secure handling of configuration and secrets
- Integration with Builder security monitoring

## Quality Gates
All standard quality gates must pass before deployment or integration.
