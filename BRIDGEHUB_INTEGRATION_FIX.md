# BridgeHub Integration Fix - BuilderOS Mobile

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (Both Issues Fixed)

---

## Problem Summary

BuilderOS Mobile iOS app was unable to communicate with BridgeHub. Two sequential issues prevented successful message delivery:

1. **Issue #1:** `invalid_payload` error
2. **Issue #2:** `invalid response from bridgehub` error

---

## Issue #1: Invalid Payload Error

### Symptom
Every message from iOS returned:
```
BridgeHub error: invalid_payload - Invalid freeform payload: context.0.role:
Invalid option: expected one of "system"|"user"|"assistant"|"note"
```

### Root Cause
Backend was sending invalid role value in context items:
```python
{
    "title": "Conversation History",
    "role": "context",  # ❌ NOT a valid BridgeHub role
    "content": "..."
}
```

BridgeHub schema only accepts: `"system"`, `"user"`, `"assistant"`, `"note"`

### Fix #1
Changed role field from `"context"` to `"note"` in both Jarvis and Codex calls.

**File:** `api/bridgehub_client.py` (lines 55, 117)

**Before:**
```python
"role": "context"  # ❌ Invalid
```

**After:**
```python
"role": "note"  # ✅ Valid
```

---

## Issue #2: Invalid Response from BridgeHub

### Symptom
After fixing Issue #1, messages were accepted by BridgeHub but backend returned:
```
Error: Invalid response from BridgeHub
```

### Root Cause
Backend code expected wrong field structure in BridgeHub response.

**Backend expected:**
```python
answer = payload.get("answer", "")  # ❌ Field doesn't exist
```

**BridgeHub actually returns:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "summary": "Codex responded: ...",
  "data": {
    "output": "The actual response text here"
  },
  "logs": [...]
}
```

The response text is in `data.output`, not `answer`.

### Fix #2
Updated response parsing to extract from correct field structure.

**File:** `api/bridgehub_client.py` (lines 198-204)

**Before:**
```python
if payload.get("ok"):
    answer = payload.get("answer", "")  # ❌ Wrong field
    duration = payload.get("duration_ms", 0)

    logger.info(f"✅ BridgeHub call successful ({duration}ms)")
    logger.debug(f"   Answer length: {len(answer)} chars")

    # Yield answer in chunks for streaming
    chunk_size = 100
    for i in range(0, len(answer), chunk_size):
        chunk = answer[i:i+chunk_size]
        yield chunk
```

**After:**
```python
if payload.get("ok"):
    # Extract answer from data.output field
    data = payload.get("data", {})
    answer = data.get("output", "")

    # Fallback to summary if output is empty
    if not answer:
        answer = payload.get("summary", "No response")

    logger.info(f"✅ BridgeHub call successful")
    logger.debug(f"   Answer length: {len(answer)} chars")

    # Yield answer in chunks for streaming
    chunk_size = 100
    for i in range(0, len(answer), chunk_size):
        chunk = answer[i:i+chunk_size]
        yield chunk
```

## BridgeHub Response Structure (Reference)

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "action": "freeform",
  "summary": "Codex responded: [brief summary]",
  "data": {
    "direction": "claude_to_codex",
    "intent": "mobile_session_query",
    "message": "Original user message",
    "context": [...],
    "metadata": {...},
    "prompt": "Full prompt sent to LLM",
    "output": "THE ACTUAL RESPONSE TEXT"
  },
  "logs": ["array", "of", "log", "messages"]
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `data.output` → The actual response to show user
- `summary` → Brief description (fallback if output is empty)
- `logs` → Debug information (not shown to user)

### Error Response

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "reason": "invalid_payload",
  "details": "Error description here"
}
```

## Testing Results

### Test Command
```bash
node /Users/Ty/BuilderOS/tools/bridgehub/dist/bridgehub.js --request '{
  "version": "bridgehub/1.0",
  "action": "freeform",
  "capsule": "/Users/Ty/BuilderOS",
  "session": "test-session",
  "payload": {
    "message": "Hello, just testing",
    "intent": "mobile_session_query",
    "context": [{
      "title": "Test Context",
      "role": "note",
      "content": "Previous message: hello"
    }],
    "metadata": {
      "source": "builderos_mobile",
      "mode": "coordination"
    }
  }
}'
```

### Result
```
JARVIS_PAYLOAD={"ok":true,"action":"freeform","summary":"Codex responded: Hi there! Looks like the relay's working—let me know if you need anything else.",...}
```

✅ **BridgeHub working correctly**

---

## Deployment

**Backend server restarted:**
```bash
pkill -f "server_persistent.py"
python3 api/server_persistent.py &
```

**Status:** ✅ Running on port 8080
**Version:** 2.0.0-persistent
**PID:** 91971

**Health Check:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "2.0.0-persistent",
  "bridgehub": {
    "ready": true
  }
}
```

## Summary of All Changes

### Files Modified
1. `api/bridgehub_client.py`:
   - Line 55: Changed `"role": "context"` → `"role": "note"` (Jarvis)
   - Line 117: Changed `"role": "context"` → `"role": "note"` (Codex)
   - Lines 198-213: Updated response parsing to use `data.output` field

### No iOS Changes Required
The iOS app code was already correct. Only backend fixes were needed.

---

## Expected Behavior Now

### User Flow
1. User sends message from iPhone → "Hello Jarvis"
2. iOS sends JSON with session_id, device_id, message
3. Backend receives, loads session history
4. Backend calls BridgeHub with:
   - User message
   - Full conversation history (role: "note")
   - CLAUDE.md context (for Jarvis only)
5. BridgeHub executes Codex/Claude
6. Backend parses response from `data.output`
7. Backend streams response chunks to iOS
8. iOS displays streaming response
9. Backend saves to session history

### Multi-turn Conversations
- ✅ Context retained between messages
- ✅ Session persists across app restarts
- ✅ Separate Jarvis and Codex conversation threads

---

## Verification Checklist

**On iPhone:**

- [ ] Send "Hello Jarvis" → Should get response (not error)
- [ ] Send "What did I just say?" → Should reference previous message
- [ ] Switch to Codex → Send message → Should get response
- [ ] Switch back to Jarvis → Previous conversation still there
- [ ] Close app, reopen, send message → Context retained

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No "invalid_payload" errors
- ✅ No "invalid response from bridgehub" errors
- ✅ Actual responses from Jarvis/Codex
- ✅ Conversation history works
