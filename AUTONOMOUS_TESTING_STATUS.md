# Autonomous Testing - Status Report

**Started:** October 25, 2025
**Mode:** Autonomous debugging loop until chat works

---

## ✅ Fixes Completed

### 1. Backend Async Iteration Error - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** `async for` requires `__aiter__` method, got coroutine
**Solution:** Changed from `async for chunk in self.client.query()` to proper two-step pattern:
```python
self.client.query(message)  # Send message
async for chunk in self.client.receive_messages():  # Receive responses
```
**Status:** Server restarted successfully

### 2. UI Simplification - COMPLETE ✅
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed "Use Claude Agent SDK" toggle
- ✅ Removed PTY Terminal tab
- ✅ Chat tab now always shows ClaudeChatView
- ✅ Simplified from 2 modes to 1 clean chat interface

**Build:** ✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**
