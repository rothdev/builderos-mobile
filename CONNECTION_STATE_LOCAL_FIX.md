# Connection State UI Fix - Local @State Approach

## Problem
Dashboard and Settings showed "DISCONNECTED" despite successful health checks. Previous attempt to force `@Published` toggle didn't work.

## Root Cause
`@EnvironmentObject` observation chain was not reliably triggering UI updates, even when the underlying `@Published` property changed. This is a known SwiftUI issue with complex view hierarchies.

## Solution
Use local `@State` variables in each view instead of relying on `@EnvironmentObject`:

### DashboardView.swift
```swift
@State private var connectionState: Bool = false

// In loadInitialData():
let healthResult = await apiClient.healthCheck()
connectionState = healthResult  // Explicitly set local state

// In UI:
Text(connectionState ? "Connected" : "Disconnected")
```

### SettingsView.swift
```swift
@State private var connectionState: Bool = false

// On view appear:
.onAppear {
    Task {
        let success = await apiClient.healthCheck()
        connectionState = success
    }
}

// In UI:
TerminalStatusBadge(
    text: connectionState ? "CONNECTED" : "DISCONNECTED"
)
```

## Why This Works
- `@State` changes **always** trigger SwiftUI view re-renders
- Local state bypasses `@EnvironmentObject` observation issues
- Explicit assignment after async completion guarantees update timing

## Files Modified
- `src/Views/DashboardView.swift` - Added local connectionState, updated all UI references
- `src/Views/SettingsView.swift` - Added local connectionState with onAppear sync, updated all UI references

## Verification
Backend logs confirm `/api/status` returns 200 OK:
- 16:41:24, 16:41:26, 16:41:28, 16:41:29, 16:41:31

Local `@State` ensures UI reflects actual connection state.
