# Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
After hot-loading the app to iPhone, the onboarding screen ("$ BUILDEROS" with crane icon) was showing instead of the main app interface with tab bar.

## Root Cause
The app uses `@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding")` to track whether the user has completed the onboarding flow. During development/testing, this value persists between app launches, causing the onboarding screen to show repeatedly even after hot reloading.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Development Onboarding Skip
Added a development-only override in `BuilderOSApp.swift` that automatically sets `hasCompletedOnboarding = true` in DEBUG builds.

**File:** `src/BuilderOSApp.swift` (lines 22-24)

```swift
#if DEBUG
// DEVELOPMENT: Skip onboarding for faster testing
// Comment this line to test onboarding flow
UserDefaults.standard.set(true, forKey: "hasCompletedOnboarding")
#endif
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Skips onboarding automatically during development
- ✅ Allows instant access to main app after hot reload
- ✅ Only active in DEBUG builds (won't affect production)
- ✅ Easy to disable by commenting out line 24

### 2. Keyboard Toolbar
Verified that `UnifiedTerminalView.swift` does NOT include any keyboard toolbar implementation. The `TerminalKeyboardToolbar.swift` file exists but is not used in the current terminal view, which is correct.

## Navigation Flow (After Fix)

```
App Launch (DEBUG build)
    ↓
BuilderOSApp.init()
    ↓
Sets hasCompletedOnboarding = true (line 24)
    ↓
body evaluates: if hasCompletedOnboarding
    ↓
Shows MainContentView
    ↓
MainContentView renders TabView
    ↓
Shows 4 tabs: Dashboard, Terminal, Preview, Settings
```

## Testing the Fix

### Hot Reload to iPhone:
1. Open Xcode and connect iPhone
2. Build and run (Cmd+R)
3. App should now show MainContentView with tab bar
4. Tap Terminal tab to see UnifiedTerminalView

### Verify Tab Bar Visible:
- ✅ Dashboard tab (grid icon)
- ✅ Terminal tab (terminal icon)
- ✅ Preview tab (globe icon)
- ✅ Settings tab (gear icon)

### To Test Onboarding Flow:
If you need to test the actual onboarding experience:
1. Comment out line 24 in `BuilderOSApp.swift`
2. Delete app from iPhone (to clear UserDefaults)
3. Build and run
4. Complete onboarding flow manually

## Build Verification
Build completed successfully with no errors:
```
xcodebuild -project BuilderOS.xcodeproj -scheme BuilderOS \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build

Result: ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
```

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/BuilderOSApp.swift` - Added development onboarding skip

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)
- ✅ `src/Views/UnifiedTerminalView.swift` - No keyboard toolbar present
- ✅ `src/Views/MainContentView.swift` - TabView correctly configured
- ✅ `src/Views/OnboardingView.swift` - Flow logic correct

## Next Steps
1. Hot reload to your iPhone
2. Verify MainContentView appears with visible tab bar
3. Navigate to Terminal tab
4. Test terminal functionality

The app should now bypass onboarding and show the main interface immediately during development!
